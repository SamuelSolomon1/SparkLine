Vortex's newest 75% keyboard, the 83-key Race 3! Do you need dedicated arrow keys that your 60% doesn't provide, but don't want the size of a TKL? A 75% may be just for you! Most of the keys are in the "normal" spot, so there's nearly no learning curve for this keyboard.

The Race 3 features a silver anodized CNC case and cone feet. It also has DSA keycaps with dye-sub legends in a vintage grey colorway with 19 extra RGBY and MAC keycaps.

3 programmable layers on top of the default layer. Assembled in Taiwan.

Key switch damage resulting from the removal of keycaps is not covered under warranty.
